# Overview of the Verify UI

## Pages in the app
* `Home` : greeting and tutorials (log in required)
* `Login`/`Log out` : login platform using st authenticator
* `Tasks`: the overview of doc need verification and the editor as well
* `Profile`: user's details and something related to UX\


## Some notice
In `Login` page, for login submission, please **double click `Login`/press `Enter`**

This may due to the customized tool I used/OS/keyboard, I will try to fix this issue later
